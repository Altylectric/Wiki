<p>For our creative section of the server, Plots, we have quite a few commands. Here we'll explain most of those, what they do, and how to use them properly.</p>
<p><sub>This is meant to be an exhaustive list, it will contain all if not a majority of commands</sub></p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Basics</strong></span></h1>
<p>Using the command: <strong>"/plots help"</strong> will show all possible help commands for the plots plugin.&nbsp;<br>One important information for these commands though, <u>remember to type in "/plots" not just "/plot".</u> "/plot" will not work, unless with the "s" at the end.</p>
<p>To confirm any plot action, use the "/plots confirm" command.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Info commands</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>"/plots info"</strong>, using this command will show you the details for the current plot you're standing / flying on. It will show informations such as:<br>Plot ID, Creation Date, Owner, Biome and more.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots list"</strong>, using this command will give you options for sub-commands such as:<br>forsale, mine, shared, world, all, unowned. The correct usage would be: "/plots list [sub-command]"<br>Example: /plots list mine<br>It will show all your owned plots.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Teleport commands</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>"/plots home"</strong>, this command has two ways to work.<br>Firstly, you can simply type "/plots home", but in the case that you've got multiple plots, you can type "/plots home [number of plot;number of plot]<br>Example: /plots home 1;0. You can see the number of your plot using "/plots info".</p>
<p><strong>"/plots visit"</strong>, the correct usage of this command is "/plots visit [player name]"<br>Example: /plots visit Paopou__</p>
<p><strong>"/plots middle"</strong> using this command you can teleport yourself into the middle of the current plot you're standing on.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Claiming commands</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>"/plots claim"</strong> let's you claim a specific plot you're standing on, aslong as it is unclaimed.<br><strong>"/plots claim auto"</strong> will let you claim the nearest plot possible.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you are only able to own <u>one</u> plot.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><br><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Settings commands</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;<u>which may be added sometime in the near future.</u></p>
<p><strong>"/plots setowner [player name]"</strong> this command sets a certain player the owner of the plot you're on, although this command is not available to the average player, yet.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots add [player name]"</strong> using this command you are able to add players to your plot which directly gives them build access as long as the plot owner is online.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots trust [player name]"</strong> this command simply does the same as the add command but, it gives the trusted player World Edit permissions as well as build permissions while the plot owner is not online.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots remove [player name]"</strong> this command removes people from your trusted list, whitelisted (add) list or just your black list.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots deny [player name]"</strong> using this command you are able to blacklist people from your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots kick [player name]"</strong> this command gives you the ability to kick people from your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots merge"</strong> lets you merge multiple plots into one (side note, not possible atm.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots unlink"</strong> lets you un-merge multiple plots into one (as the merge is not possible, there is no use for unlink as of this time.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots sethome"</strong> lets you set a new home point in your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots alias (set | remove) {alias}"</strong> lets you set a name for your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots desc {description}"</strong> lets you add a description for your plot, although this is not accessible as for now.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots music"</strong> lets you set a music(disc) for your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots biome"</strong> lets you change the biome of your plot.<br>Example: /plots (set)biome badlands</p>
<p><strong>"/plots flag"</strong> opens a help menu for the flag command, helping you further in terms of flags. (No, not the flags of countries etc.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots done"</strong> marks your plot as finished.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots continue"</strong> marks your plot as unfinished again and lets you build.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots set"</strong> gives you an option of things which you are able to do on your plot, such as:<br>set biome, set alias, set home, set floor etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots clear"</strong> lets you clear your plot (Warning, everything you've built <strong>WILL</strong> be removed.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots delete"</strong> lets you delete your entire plot, unclaiming it for you. (Warning, everything you've built <strong>WILL</strong> be removed as well as unclaimed.)</p>
<p><u>Things will be updated/edited after changes have been made, more commands are accessible or commands are restricted.</u></p>
