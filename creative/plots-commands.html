<p>For our creative section of the server, Plots, we have quite a few commands. Here i'll explain most of those, what they do, and how to use them properly.</p>
<p>Just a heads-up, this Comment will be including most if not even all the commands, so it will be quite the long list.</p>
<p>First on, we've got the <mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Basic commands</strong></mark>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the command: <strong>"/plots help"</strong> will show all possible help commands for the plots plugin.&nbsp;<br>One important information for these commands tho, remember to type in "/plots" not just "/plot". "/plot" will not work, unless with the "s" at the end.</p>
<p>To confirm any plot action, use the "/plots confirm" command.</p>
<p>Now, we're continuing with the <mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Info commands</strong></mark> such as:</p>
<p><strong>"/plots info"</strong>, using this command will show you the details for the current plot you're standing / flying on. It will show informations such as:<br>Plot ID, Creation Date, Owner, Biome and more.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots list"</strong>, using this command will give you options for sub-commands such as:<br>forsale, mine, shared, world, all, unowned. The correct usage would be: "/plots list [sub-command]"<br>Example: /plots list mine<br>It will show all your owned plots.</p>
<p>Next we've got <mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Teleport commands</strong></mark>:</p>
<p><strong>"/plots home"</strong>, this command has two ways to work.<br>Firstly, you can simply type "/plots home", but in the case that you've got multiple plots, you can type "/plots home [number of plot;number of plot]<br>Example: /plots home 1;0. You can see the number of your plot using "/plots info".</p>
<p><strong>"/plots visit"</strong>, the correct usage of this command is "/plots visit [player name]"<br>Example: /plots visit Paopou__</p>
<p><strong>"/plots middle"</strong> using this command you can teleport yourself into the middle of the current plot you're standing on.</p>
<p>Now we come to the <mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Claiming section</strong></mark>.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots claim"</strong> let's you claim a specific plot you're standing on, aslong as it is unclaimed.<br><strong>"/plots claim auto"</strong> will let you claim the nearest plot possible.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you are only able to own one plot.<br>Now for the last part, we come to some <mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Settings commands</strong></mark> you may do, or just simply some settings available which might get added sometime in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots setowner [player name]"</strong> this command sets a certain player the owner of the plot you're on, although this command is not available to the average player, yet.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots add [player name]"</strong> using this command you are able to add players to your plot which directly gives them build access aslong as the plot owner is online.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots trust [player name]"</strong> this command simply does the same as the add command but, it gives the trusted player World Edit permissions aswell as build permissions while the plot owner is not online.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots remove [player name]"</strong> this command removes people from your trusted list, whitelisted (add) list or just your black list.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots deny [player name]"</strong> using this command you are able to blacklist people from your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots kick [player name]"</strong> this command gives you the ability to kick people from your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots merge"</strong> lets you merge multiple plots into one (side note, not possible atm.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots unlink"</strong> lets you un-merge multiple plots into one (as the merge is not possible, there is no use for unlink as of this time.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots sethome"</strong> lets you set a new home point in your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots alias (set | remove) {alias}"</strong> lets you set a name for your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots desc {description}"</strong> lets you add a description for your plot, although this is not accessible as for now.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots music"</strong> lets you set a music(disc) for your plot.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots biome"</strong> lets you change the biome of your plot.<br>Example: /plots (set)biome badlands</p>
<p><strong>"/plots flag"</strong> opens a help menu for the flag command, helping you further in terms of flags. (No, not the flags of countries etc.)</p>
<p><strong>"/plots done"</strong> marks your plot as finished.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots continue"</strong> marks your plot as unfinished again and lets you build.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots set"</strong> gives you an option of things which you are able to do on your plot, such as:<br>set biome, set alias, set home, set floor etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots clear"</strong> lets you clear your plot (Warning, everything you've built <strong>WILL</strong> be removed.</p>
<p><strong>"/plots delete"</strong> lets you delete your entire plot, unclaiming it for you. (Warning, everything you've built <strong>WILL</strong> be removed aswell as unclaimed.)</p>
<p><u>Things will get updated/edited after changes have been made, more commands are accessible or commands are restricted.</u></p>
