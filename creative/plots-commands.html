<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Plots: Commands</strong></span></h1>
<p>The Creative Mode section of our server uses a plugin known as Plots. Plots has quite a few commands. This section explains the commands, what they do, and how to utilize them properly and to their full extent.</p>
<p><i><sub>This is meant to be an exhaustive list; it will contain all, if not the majority of the commands. Further, </sub><strong><sub>all commas and periods in quotations are in place for proper punctuation</sub></strong><sub> and are </sub><strong><sub><u>NOT</u></sub></strong><sub> to be used as part of the command. Thank you for your understanding.</sub></i></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Basic Commands</strong></span></h2>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots help"</strong> will show all possible help commands for the plots plugin.&nbsp;<br>One important piece of information about these commands, though, is to remember to type in "/plots," not just "/plot." "/plot" will not work unless it has the "s" at the end.</p>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots confirm" </strong>will be used to confirm any plot action. This allows the system to know you intentionally typed and submitted your previous command.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Informational Commands</strong></span></h2>
<p>The command:<strong> “/plots info"</strong> will show you the details for the current plot you're standing/flying on. It will show information such as:<br>Plot ID, Creation Date, Owner, Biome, and more.</p>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots list"</strong> will give you potential options as sub-commands, such as:<br>For sale, mine, shared, world, all, unowned. The correct usage would be: <strong>"/plots list [insert sub-command here]."</strong><br>For example, the command <strong>“/plots list mine,” </strong>as mentioned above, will display all your owned plots to you in a small menu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Teleportation Commands</strong></span></h2>
<p>The command:<strong> "/plots home"</strong> will set your home based on player input. Your home is your designated main area for teleportation.<br>Typically, when starting, you can type <strong>“/plots home,” </strong>but in the unlikely case that you've got multiple plots (as plots are currently restricted to one per player), you can type <strong>“/plots home [insert number of plot here; insert number of plot here]”</strong><br>For example, <strong>“/plots home 1;0.”</strong> You can view plot numbers using the command <strong>“/plots info.”</strong></p>
<p>The command: <strong>“/plots visit</strong>” will teleport you to the home plot of the player mentioned in the command. The correct usage of this command would be <strong>"/plots visit [insert player name here]."</strong><br>For example, to teleport to the home of user Paopou__ or Viceroy_la_Richt, you would submit the command "<strong>/plots visit Paopou__" </strong>or <strong>“/plots visit Viceroy_la_Richt.”</strong></p>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots middle"</strong> will teleport you to the exact centre of the current plot you're within.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Land-Claim Commands</strong></span></h2>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots claim"</strong> will allow you to claim a specific plot you're standing on as long as the requirement of it being unclaimed is fulfilled.</p>
<p>The command: <strong>"/plots claim auto" </strong>will allow you to claim the nearest unclaimed plot (within a reasonable distance).</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that players are currently restricted to the ownership of <u>one</u> plot.</p>
