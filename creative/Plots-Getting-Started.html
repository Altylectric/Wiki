<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Welcome To Plots!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-small">Let's get you started!</span></p>
<p>The "Plots" represents the creative section within our server, where individuals are free to construct anything they desire, within the bounds of respect and appropriateness. Each player possesses their own plot, invulnerable to destruction or alteration by others. Once you log on our server, you will be able to switch between creative and survival. Once in the creative world, you can find an empty plot to claim as your own (using the /plot claim) and then start building!<strong> </strong>Additionally, the server has WorldEdit, which offers a vast variety of tools that can help you out with your amazing builds! You can read more about WorldEdit in our wiki! Have fun!</p>
