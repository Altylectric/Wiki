<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Welcome To Plots!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-small">Let's start plotting your next masterpiece!</span></p>
<p>The "Plots" represent the creative section within our server, where individuals are free to construct anything they desire within the bounds of respect and appropriateness. Each player possesses their own plot, which is invulnerable to destruction or alteration by others. Once you log on to our server, you will be able to switch between creative and survival. Once in the creative world, you can find an empty plot to claim as your own (using the /plot claim) and then start building!<strong> </strong>Additionally, the server has WorldEdit, which offers a wide variety of tools to help you with your amazing builds! You can read more about WorldEdit in our wiki! Have fun!</p>
