<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Plots: World Edit</strong></span></h1>
<p>Our server is comprised of many add-ons and data packs. One of these is the Worldedit addon. World Edit is an awesome tool in Minecraft that lets you quickly change the world around you by helping you alter and create structures much more easily than the traditional ways of playing. It utilises a vast array of commands. It is one of the most popular Minecart mods/addons and is truly a builder's dream!</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Basic Commands</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>//wand</strong>: This gives you a magic wand in the game. With it, you can select areas by clicking.</p>
<p><strong>//pos1</strong> and <strong>//pos2</strong>: These commands set your selection's beginning and endpoints. You can also click with your wand to set these points.</p>
<p><strong>//set &lt;block&gt;</strong>: This one's like magic. It changes all the blocks in your selected area to whatever type you want. So, if you want to turn everything into stone, just type "//set stone".</p>
<p><strong>//replace &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;</strong>: This is super handy. It swaps one type of block for another in your selection. For example, if you want to turn all the dirt into grass, type "//replace dirt grass".</p>
<p><strong>//copy</strong>: It copies the blocks you've selected.</p>
<p><strong>//cut</strong>: This is like copying but also removes the blocks from where they were.</p>
<p><strong>//paste</strong>: This command lets you place those blocks back down after copying or cutting.</p>
<p><strong>//undo</strong>: Oops! Did you make a mistake? This command can undo your last action.</p>
<p><strong>//redo</strong>: This brings it back if you undid something by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>//expand &lt;direction&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</strong> and <strong>//contract &lt;direction&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</strong>: These make your selection bigger or smaller in a particular direction. Very useful!</p>
<p>That's a good start! With these, you can do a lot in Minecraft with WorldEdit. Many more sophisticated and complex commands are available, but these aren't necessary to make great use of this mod! If you still wish to learn more, you may continue reading this page. Here are some more sophisticated commands of this mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Complex Commands</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>//paste -a</strong>: This command pastes the copied region without air blocks, meaning only blocks with substance will be pasted. It's useful for copying and pasting structures without worrying about filling in air blocks.</p>
<p>Example: //paste -a&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>//generate</strong>: This command generates terrain in the selected region. It's handy for quickly creating landscapes or filling areas with natural features like trees or ores.</p>
<p>Example: //generate trees (which will create a landscape of, Trees. of course)</p>
<p><strong>//smooth</strong>: This command smooths out terrain within the selected region. It's useful for making rough landscapes look more natural.</p>
<p>Example: //smooth 3 (the number is the level of smoothness, practically)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>//hollow</strong>: This command hollows out a solid structure, leaving just the outer shell. It's helpful when you need to create a shell for a building or clear out the interior of a structure.</p>
<p>Example: //hollow</p>
<p><strong>//cyl</strong>: This command creates a cylinder of blocks. It's useful for building towers, pillars, or other cylindrical structures.</p>
<p>Example: //cyl stone &lt;radius&gt; &lt;height&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>//faces</strong>: This command fills in the faces of a selection, creating a solid block where previously only the edges existed.</p>
<p>Example: //faces&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>//replacenear</strong>: This command replaces blocks near the player's position within a specified radius. It helps make large-scale changes to the environment without having to select a specific region.</p>
<p>Example: //replacenear 10 stone grass (this specific command will replace all stone blocks within ten blocks of the user with grass)</p>
<p><strong>//regen</strong>: This command regenerates the blocks within the selection. It helps restore areas that have been modified back to their original state.</p>
<p>Example: //regen</p>
<p><strong>//overlay</strong>: This command overlays one material over another within the selection. It helps add textures or patterns to existing structures.</p>
