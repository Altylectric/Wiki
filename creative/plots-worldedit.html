<p>Our server is comprised of many addons and data-packs. One of these is the Worldedit addon. World Edit is an awesome tool in Minecraft that lets you quickly change the world around you, by helping you alter and create structures a lot more easier than the traditional ways of playing, Utilising a vast array of commands. It is one of the most popular minecart mods/addons, and is truly a builders dream!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Basic Commands</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>//wand</strong>: This gives you a magic wand in the game. With it, you can select areas by clicking.</p>
<p><strong>//pos1</strong> and <strong>//pos2</strong>: These commands set the beginning and end points of your selection. You can also just click with your wand to set these points.</p>
<p><strong>//set &lt;block&gt;</strong>: This one's like magic. It changes all the blocks in your selected area to whatever type you want. So, if you want to turn everything into stone, just type "//set stone".</p>
<p><strong>//replace &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;</strong>: This is super handy. It swaps one type of block for another in your selection. For example, if you want to turn all the dirt into grass, just type "//replace dirt grass".</p>
<p><strong>//copy</strong>: It copies the blocks you've selected.</p>
<p><strong>//cut</strong>: This is like copying, but it also removes the blocks from where they were.</p>
<p><strong>//paste</strong>: After copying or cutting, this command lets you place those blocks back down.</p>
<p><strong>//undo</strong>: Oops! Made a mistake? This command can undo your last action.</p>
<p><strong>//redo</strong>: If you undid something by mistake, this brings it back.</p>
<p><strong>//expand &lt;direction&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</strong> and <strong>//contract &lt;direction&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</strong>: These make your selection bigger or smaller in a particular direction. Very useful!</p>
