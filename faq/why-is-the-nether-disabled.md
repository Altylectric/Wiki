# Why is the Nether Disabled?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, We have the nether disabled for quite a few reasons:\


* &#x20;The main reason being that we believe the nether spreads players out from each other, when we want everyone to interact with each other in an already large world
* A majority of nether materials can be found in the overworld, while the blocks/items not available will be added to the shop or through a crafting recipe
* The nether causes quite a bit of lag, While I understand this can be solved through pre-generation and other methods, we want to keep the server running as smooth as possible
* Ever made a nether portal, trying to link it up to your base, and it goes to someone else's base? We don't want that to happen, especially if you have PvP turned on, leaving you to be attacked instantly or possibly portal-trapped

While we understand that the nether is also used for many good things, We currently have it disabled for the reasons listed above, However, This may change in the future!
