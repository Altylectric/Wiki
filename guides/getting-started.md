# ðŸ“˜ Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
Looking for a faster guide? Look at our [quick-start-guide.md](quick-start-guide.md "mention")!
{% endhint %}

## Choosing a starting location:

Firstly, Start up Minecraft: Java Edition and Connect to the server at `Continental-MC.net`, then you can select your spawn location by walking forward! We recommend **North America,** as it has some good starting materials, However, you may choose to start anywhere! To view good starting locations, check out our [map](https://map.continental-mc.net/) and our [ores.md](ores.md "mention") page!

{% hint style="danger" %}
While Africa has a majority of resources, Choosing it is not recommended for newer players as it lacks resources on the surface.
{% endhint %}

Once you choose your spawn location, jump down into the "portal" with your chosen location's name above it. Then, the server will randomly teleport you to a spot in your chosen area!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you happen to get a bad spawn location, or just change your mind, You can do `/spawn` to choose your location again (Has a cooldown)
{% endhint %}

## Travelling around the world

The server has many different ways to get around! Here are some of the major ways players get around:

* [Vehicles](vehicles.md)
* [Teleporting to other players ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* [Teleporting to public towns](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Towns: A basic guide

On our server, towns are one of the major features in the server. Towns are used for claiming land, Wars, and More! Once you find a suitable location for a base, you can create a town using `/t new [Town Name]`. Make sure you replace `[Town Name]` With what you want to call your new home! Afterwards, claim land by doing `/t claim` in the chunks next to your town _(You can view chunk borders by press "F3" and "G" at the same time)_

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to deposit money into your town bank! You can do this by doing `/t deposit [amount]` \
\
Not depositing money can lead to your town being deleted! Make sure you have enough money in the town bank!
{% endhint %}

### Important Town Commands

* /t invite \[Player]
  * Invites players to your town, where they can then interact with the land in your town!
* /t claim
  * Claims land for your town on a chunk-by-chunk basis
* /t toggle neutral
  * This command can be used to toggle town neutrality, Your town is \***AUTOMATICALLY NEUTRAL UPON CREATION**\*, It takes 1 day to fully change your town neutral status
* /t spawn
  * Teleports you to your towns "spawn point", this will automatically be set to the block where you first created your town, however this can be changed by doing /t set spawn
* /towny map
  * A simple command that shows you your towns claims
* /t trust \[player]
  * Can be used to "trust" players who are not apart of your town, allowing them to build/destroy blocks
