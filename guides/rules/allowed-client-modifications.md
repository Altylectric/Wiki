# Allowed Client Modifications

**At Continental MC, you have the option to use some client-side mods to improve your experience! Here are a few examples:**

> ## [Just Enough Items (JEI)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei)
>
> Just Enough Items (JEI) is a mod that allows you to look up the crafting recipes for any block in the game. It comes in handy when you're trying to make a potion or craft complex items like Glazed Terracotta.
>
> An addon mod to JEI is Just Enough Resources. It shows mob drops, ore distribution, dungeon loot, and plant drops. On CMC, it can be used for Mob/Plant Drops due to our custom world.

> ## [Mouse Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mouse-tweaks)
>
> Mouse Tweaks is a must-have when it comes to client-side modpacks! It offers many useful features, including the ability to quickly move items to and from chests. A very handy tool indeed.

> ## [Xaero’s World Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map)
>
> Xaero’s World Map can help with setting waypoints and showing your latest death spot. This can be a useful way to navigate the map without having to look at your F3 screen the whole time.

> ## [Xaero’s Minimap (Fairplay Edition)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap-fair-play-edition)
>
> This version of Xaero’s Minimap is allowed on CMC. It provides a minimap that can help you navigate and find your way around the world. Note that the non-Fairplay version is not allowed on CMC.

> ## [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica)
>
> Litematica is a mod that allows you to overlay a build onto the world and provides an outline to guide your construction. This is especially useful for transferring creative world builds to CMC.

**These are just a few mods we recommend. If there's another mod not listed here that you want to use, feel free to ask if it's allowed by creating a ticket in the Discord server or by using the `@oncallstaff [question]` command in the game!**
