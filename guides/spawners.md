# ðŸ”¦ Spawners

Our server features a custom plugin for spawners, designed by our talented developer Yopal. Discover how to use it and explore its various features!

## Acquiring Spawners

To obtain a spawner, you have two options:

- **Purchase from the Shop:** Use the `/shop` command to acquire a spawner.
- **Find Naturally Generated Spawners:** In the world, you might come across naturally generated spawners. The best part is that you don't need a silk touch enchantment!

## Using the Spawner

1. **Crafting:** Take a spawn egg (available for purchase from `/shop` or obtainable through the [thrifty](../items/enchantments.md)
 enchantment) and combine it with the spawner in a crafting table.
2. **Placement:** Once crafted, you can place your spawner wherever you desire.

## Stacking Spawners

You have the option of stacking spawners:

1. **Stacking Mechanism:** To stack spawners, simply place two spawners with the same spawn egg next to each other.
2. **Mobs Stacking:** Note that not only spawners but also the spawned mobs will stack. This is made possible by one of our anti-lag plugins.

Enjoy!
