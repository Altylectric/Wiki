# ⚡️Quick-Start Guide

**Choosing a Starting Location:**
Log into Minecraft: Java Edition and connect to our server. Choose your spawn location (we suggest North America for resources) by walking forward. Check the map for starting locations. Avoid Africa due to limited surface resources. Jump into the portal for your chosen area.

**Travelling the World:**
Get around using vehicles, teleporting to other players, or teleporting to public towns. Different methods are available for fast travel.

**Creating Towns:**
Towns are essential for claiming land, wars, and more. Create a town with `/t new [Town Name]`. Claim land using `/t claim`. Remember to deposit money into your town bank to avoid deletion.

**Important Town Commands:**
Use commands like `/t invite [Player]` to invite players to your town, `/t toggle neutral` to toggle neutrality, and `/t spawn` to teleport to your town's spawn point. Trust players using `/t trust [player]`.
